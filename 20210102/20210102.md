## Rule 30
 An array is seeded with a single 1 value, the rest are 0. Then the array is displayed in a circle, at the centre.

In each iteration, the layers are moved outwards. The central layer is updated using [Wolfram's Rule 30]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_30")

For each set of three elements, p,q,r, the element exists in the iteration if 
```
p XOR (q OR r) == true
```

Set to run slow at first to avoid distress to photo-sensitive people.
